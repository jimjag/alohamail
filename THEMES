Version 0.8.6
Date: Mar 9, 2003

Theme support is still very much work in progress, and the spcifications 
are far from being solid.  At the end, themes will be much more flexible 
than they are now.

Theme authors should be aware that any themes created now based on the 
default may (and probably will) break in future releases.  Please feel 
free to send any suggestions to either the forums or mailling lists.
